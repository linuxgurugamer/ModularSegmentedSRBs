This will list known issues with the mod.  This document will most likely not be in the final release

Issue:	Reverting to launch has a tendency to instead switch focus to the next vessel in flight, in my case, a 
		discarded lander in orbit around Duna; this tends to happen more often than not following a crash or RUD, 
		rather than simply resetting while in optimal flight or on the pad.
Status: Unable to replicate, requested more information

Issue:  When stack is broken, open end is spewing same thrust (?) as motor end
		Motor continues to spew same thrust
Status: Known, fix postponed until later

Issue:	Parachutes don't work.
			1) They don't generate any braking force when deployed; 
			2) the fuel segment variants animation breaks
		Motor-with-fuel-segment variants engine nozzles cannot be adjusted
Status:	Waiting for new part models.  Possible solution would be to split parts into individual parts rather than using the PartVariants
